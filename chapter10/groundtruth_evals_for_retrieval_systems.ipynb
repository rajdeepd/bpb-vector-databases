        "\n",
        "When developing a RAG application, the retrieval component plays a critical role in the entire system. Thus, we need to be able to quickly measure the search quality, where directly affects an end-to-end LLM powered application's ability to accurately answer queries based on contextualized knowledge. In this notebook, we walkthrough how you can leverage your curated ground truth datasets containing golden contexts that are relevant to a query to perform evalaution using well established information retrieval (IR) metrics of your app. The key different from this ground-truth-based workflow than RAG triad is that RAG triad is reference free, and is mostly suitable for cases when ground truth data are not available.\n",
